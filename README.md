Random word generation provided by https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/
Random words are REALLY weird and many do not appear in my api,
thus, many will not be recognized.

All user icons from Font Awesome and Google Icons.

App icons (the ones in my icons folder) made by Pixel perfect from www.flaticon.com, free to use licence.

This app is robust, reliable, and useful. While it's concept is not by any
means revolutionary, it does it's job well and withstands harsh testing.
The current dictionary is responsive on the smallest screens, and only begins to lose
formatting at around < 200px screen width. It is capable of producing 
defintions for a variety of words, and features up to four different audio 
pronounciations. Additional features such as history and random word search
add to the experience of using this app.

Thank you for taking your time, we hope you enjoy Dason's Dictionary.
